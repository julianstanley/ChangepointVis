\title{Visual Interface for Labeling and learning a penalty function}
\usage{
cpLabel(data, unsupervised_changepoints = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A univariate dataset.}

\item{unsupervised_changepoints}{a boolean value, if set to TRUE, the function will try to load changepoints that were created by cpVisulaise and use these to label the data on startup.}
}
\value{
starts a shiny app in a new window
}
\description{
{ This Function implements a simple changepoint labeling tool as well as the penalty learning algorithm to learn a penalty function that can be used to accurately predict changepoints in labeled data.

The function starts a shiny server and acompanying web interface that displays:
\enumerate{
\item The univariate dataset (top left)
\item Control Pannel (top right)
}
The main form of interaction with the interface is through selecting a label type (top right) and then selecting regions of the data which you would like to assign said label type.
Additionaly, by clicking "learn Penalties" a penalty function is learned from the labeled data and the resulting changepoint(s) are displayed.

}
}
\details{
{This function is used to both label a dataset and to learn a penalty function from the labeled data. Furthermore, this labeled data can be exported for use in other applications.
\describe{
\item{NoLabel}{Used to create regions where no changepoints should be.}
\item{ChangePointRegion}{Used to create regions where changepoints should be.}
\item{NumberofSegments}{Used to determine how many models should be evaluated for the given labeled data. Roughly equates to the number of changepoints you belive should be in the data.}
\item{LearnPenalties}{Run the penalty learning algorithm given the labeled data. Returns predicted changepoints.}
\item{SaveLabels}{Saves the labels as a .csv file.}
}

In addition to the base functionality, this function also allows the data to be pre-labeled using changepoints found using the unsupervised methods in cpVisualise. This can be done by first selecting and saving a solution in cpVisualise (by clicking the "save changepoints" button) and then running cpLabel with \strong{unsupervised_changepoints} set to TRUE.
